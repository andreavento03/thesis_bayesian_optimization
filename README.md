# Thesis: Bayesian Mean-Variance Optimization

This repository contains data and Jupyter Notebooks related to my Bachelor's thesis on Bayesian Mean-Variance Optimization.

## Contents

*   **Code/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data processing, analysis, and model implementation.
    *   `Dataset_generation.ipynb`: Notebook for preparing and generating datasets.
    *   `MVO_code.ipynb`: Notebook for implementing Mean-Variance Optimization techniques, likely with a Bayesian approach.
*   **Data/**: Contains various CSV files used as inputs for the analysis.

This project explores the application of Bayesian methods to portfolio optimization.
